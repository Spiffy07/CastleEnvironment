# Castle Environment

This project uses Unreal Engine 5.2 and consists of a cinematic environment of castle walls, lake, and woody area as the main level design with mountains, hilly terrain, as well as Lumen lighting. 
It also includes a small target game. 

Due to the sheer size of UE projects, this repo does not include the Megascan or Quixel Bridge assests.
The following youtube link will have a short descriptive view of the current project.
